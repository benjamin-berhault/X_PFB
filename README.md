# About The Project

This repo contains all my code source and documentation used in the challenge [**"Predicting response times of the Paris Fire Brigade Vehicles"**](https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/21/).

The root and **helpers** subfolder contain all the python files and Jupyter notebooks.  
The **Doc** folder contains my documents for "Memoire de certification".  

# Environment

The code source was written in  [**Google Colab**] (https://colab.research.google.com/).  
It is recommended to use a personal Google Drive to store permanently the datasets and the artifacts (models and intermediary data). 

The following folders have to be created before running the notebooks: 
*   **data**: one has to download the dataset (csv files) provided by the challenge,
*  **data/prepared**: the intermediary datasets will be created in this folder.
* **models**: models will be saved in this folder.
* **LOGS**: used to store logs
* 

# Running the notebooks

The notebooks must be run in a specific order according to the prefix number of the notebook name.
